# Markdown Translator

A powerful command-line tool that uses Google Gemini AI to translate markdown and MDX files from English to any specified language while preserving formatting and structure.

Instead of including the translation code in the `StarRocks/starrocks` repo, it is separate so that it can be used for files in other repos, or outside of GitHub.

Follow the [README](https://github.com/StarRocks/markdown-translator/blob/main/README.md)
